Lightue is a lightweight and simple model-view framework inspired by Vue.js

Try the live example [here](https://codepen.io/lxl898/pen/vYyooWK)

## Highlights

- Super lightweight (<2KB min+br)
- State driven dom updates
- JS object style template, great editor support in JS context
- Flexible function style components
- Low overhead, easily setup and run

## Compatability

Lightue supports all modern browsers except IE.
To get legacy browser support, you can choose version 0.1.2 which supports down to IE 10.

## TodoMVC

If you are already familiar with some other FE frameworks, you can learn Lightue quickly by comparing [todo.html](https://github.com/smalllong/lightue/blob/master/todo.html) with [other implementations](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)
